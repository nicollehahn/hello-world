# hello-world
testing &amp; playing with a repository
hmmmm.... feel like a kid at a playground when I am on github.
i am now at a place where I feel confident enough to learn with others at a developing / ruby job.  i need to be challenged and to start putting the practice to real life work.  here is to another great adventure!
